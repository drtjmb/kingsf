Use stored field for result citation eg
http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/latest/searchindex_api.html

advanced search should use a ModelSearchIndex (ie creates an index based on the model)?

carousel should pick up items where featured=True

add include_in_showcase to allow KF to choose items to appear in carousel (via /admin)

create a template for a publication 'citation' - used by carousel and by search results page
